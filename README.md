# votersim
Project Week 2 at Wyncode. Cohort 9.

You are going to build a program that allows a user to create a directory of politicians and voters. Users will be able to Create, List, Update and Delete both voters and politicians from the directory.

This is a common set of behaviour, and collectively are refered to as CRUD actions.

Voters and Politicians are both People with names. Voters however, have a political affliliation of either Liberal, Conservative, Tea Party, Socialist, or Neutral, while politicians have a party affiliation either Democrat or Republican.

Once the program starts, you should be greated with a “main menu” that allows you to perform all the CRUD actions on either voter or politicians: (C )reate, (L)ist, (U)pdate, (D)elete.

This is a large project, but it would be significantly more complex to solve without OOP. This is a great opportunity to recognize the value OOP.
